Lungs are otherwise remarkable for a persistent area of poorly defined opacity anteriorly in the right middle lobe projecting in the retrosternal area on the lateral view, and corresponding to an area of apparent scarring on ___ chest CTA. Small pleural effusions have resolved since the prior study. Immediately lateral to the right hilum is a new area of poorly defined opacity approximately at right eighth posterior rib level. New poorly defined right juxta-hilar opacity, possibly due to an early/focal pneumonia given clinical suspicion for pneumonia. However, recurrent malignancy is an additional consideration, particularly considering adjacent persistent enlargement and increased density of the right hilum. Management recommendation for this finding is treatment for pneumonia with short-term followup radiographs.
