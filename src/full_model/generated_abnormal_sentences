Generated sentence: Bibasilar atelectasis.
Reference sentence: There is a focal consolidation at the left lung base adjacent to the lateral hemidiaphragm. Focal consolidation at the left lung base, possibly representing aspiration or pneumonia.

Generated sentence: There is mild pulmonary edema.
Reference sentence: There is mild vascular engorgement. Central vascular engorgement.

Generated sentence: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Reference sentence: The cardiomediastinal silhouette is remarkable for aortic arch calcifications.

Generated sentence: Atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic arch.
Reference sentence: The cardiomediastinal silhouette is remarkable for aortic arch calcifications.

Generated sentence: The heart size is top normal.
Reference sentence: The cardiomediastinal silhouette is remarkable for aortic arch calcifications. The heart is top normal in size.

Generated sentence: There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
Reference sentence: There is persistent thoracic kyphosis with mild wedging of a mid thoracic vertebral body.

Generated sentence: There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Reference sentence: Each hilum is mildly prominent, probably suggesting mild prominence of central pulmonary vessels, but there is no frank congestive heart failure. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mild perihilar prominence, suspected to represent mildly prominent pulmonary vessels without definite pneumonia.

Generated sentence: The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
Reference sentence: The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits. Each hilum is mildly prominent, probably suggesting mild prominence of central pulmonary vessels, but there is no frank congestive heart failure. Mild perihilar prominence, suspected to represent mildly prominent pulmonary vessels without definite pneumonia.

Generated sentence: The lungs are clear without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Reference sentence: Each hilum is mildly prominent, probably suggesting mild prominence of central pulmonary vessels, but there is no frank congestive heart failure.
