Reference report: PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position. Comparison is made with several preceding chest examinations dated ___, ___ and ___. Moderate cardiac enlargement. There is no typical configurational abnormality, however, beginning double contour on the frontal view and straightened left cardiac border suggestive of some mild enlargement of the left atrium supported by the mild deviation of the descending aorta to the left at that level. The pulmonary vasculature demonstrates an upper zone redistribution pattern and there is some increased perivascular haze on the bases. Although there is no clear evidence of fluid in the pleural spaces, the lateral view discloses some mild blunting of the posterior dependent portions of the pleural space. There is no evidence of any acute pulmonary infiltrate such as were diagnosed on the latest preceding chest examination ___ ___, to exist in the mid left lung field. In comparison, it is extended to examinations ___ and ___. Comparison with today's study demonstrates a mildly increased upper zone redistribution, coinciding with some increased interstitial elements and subtle changes of pleural effusion in the posterior pleural space. These findings are in support of the clinically suggested diagnosis that the patient had significant interval weight gain, probably related to noncompliance with Lasix medication. Thus, there is no evidence of acute pulmonary infiltrates, but comparison suggests mild degree of chronic CHF. A followup examination in two to three weeks could confirm suggested diagnosis, if the subtle vascular changes return to normal.
